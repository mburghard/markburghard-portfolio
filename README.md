I have changed the main feature of the demo to be a product page similar to the Yokohama website's product pages, mirroring a lot of its appearance and functionality.

Hopefully this illustrates a lot of my skills considerably better. It demonstrates use of common React Hooks, and I have done my best in the limited time I've had to make the code as clean and reusable I can while still getting a lot of features working, like the autoplay with shared progress bars, the discreet section snap scrolling, the interactive sidebar, and the autoplay in the features section. I'm still tinkering with the css and spacing, but it should be pretty good on most computer displays. It gets pretty close to the original on standard 1920x1080.

I'm currently working on implementing some more features from the site to demonstrate some other skills. Specifically, I'm starting on the dot/line info popouts on the Features and Benefits section of the page. I haven't had time to do it yet but I'm eager to get it working. I'm also considering performance optimizations.

Thanks for taking the time to look through this, talk soon!
