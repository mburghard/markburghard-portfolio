Hello, and welcome to my portfolio!

This site contains a homepage highlighting some of my skills as well as a product demo page based on the product pages for Yokohama tires. Though the design has been mimicked, all the code is 100% original. It has a number of interactive features including an interactive sidebar, custom snap scrolling implementation, animated buttons, and an interactive product showcase with a number of animated and interactive features.

The code has been engineered to highlight a single responsibility principle design philosophy and demonstrate knowledge of React, including state management, component heirarchy, and built in and custom hooks. There's also a bit of backend Java code from one of my previous projects. Thank you for taking the time to take a look!
